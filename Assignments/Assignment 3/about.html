          Monica Galetti is the owner of Recipe Mate (established 2023) and one
          of the best-known and highly renowned female chefs in London. Born in
          Samoa, Monica developed an early interest in food – a hugely important
          part of Samoan culture – before moving to New Zealand, where she
          trained as a chef. Chef Monica moved to Britain in 1999 to work
          alongside Chef Michel Roux Jr at two Michelin starred Le Gavroche
          where she was classically trained and introduced to fine dining
          kitchens.

          Working alongside a highly regarded team inclusive of Monica’s now
          husband, David Galetti who was the sommelier at Le Gavroche – Chef
          Monica honed her skills and experience which would eventually serve as
          foundations to the opening of Mere alongside David. 14 years of
          MasterChef: The Professionals and many uses of Marmite later, Monica
          continues to fulfil her role as chef, judge, mentor, author, friend,
          wife, mum and daughter of Mere. Monica is the author of three books:
          Monica’s Kitchen, The Skills and Monica at Home, which was released in
          September 2021.
